/*
Given a linked list, reverse it.

Linked list: A data structure which is made up of nodes. 
Each node holds some data and a pointer to the next node. 
The first node is referenced using a pointer called head and the last nodeâ€™s next pointer is set to null.

Example 1:
Input: 1->2->3->NULL
Output: 3->2->1->NULL
Explanation: The linked list is reversed by sending first node in the end and bringing last node to the front.

Example 2:
Input: 1->NULL
Output: 1->NULL
Explanation: The reverse of a single node linked list is the original list itself.
